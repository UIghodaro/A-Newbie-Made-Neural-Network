# A Newbie Made Neural Network
 A Personal Project created with the aim of properly understanding the workings of NNs in practice, as well as to self-teach numpy, pandas, matplotlib and basic data analysis techniques.

# Dependencies
Numpy: "pip install numpy"
Pandas: "pip install pandas"
Kagglehub with Pandas adapter: "pip install kagglehub[pandas-datasets]" 

Specifically for EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis):
Matplotlib: "pip install matplotlib"
Seaborn: "pip install seaborn"

# The Dataset
Using the Telco Customer Churn dataset found on Kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/blastchar/telco-customer-churn/data
THIS WILL BE AUTOMATICALLY INSTALLED UPON RUNNING ANY OF THE MAIN PYTHON FILES AND WILL RESULT 

Goal: Classify which customers will churn and predict behaviour to retain customers

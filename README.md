# A Newbie Made Neural Network
 A Personal Project created with the aim of properly understanding the workings of NNs in practice, as well as to self-teach numpy, pandas, matplotlib and basic data analysis techniques.

# Dependencies
Numpy, Pandas, Kagglehub with Pandas adapter 

Specifically for EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis):
Matplotlib: "pip install matplotlib"
Seaborn: "pip install seaborn"

# The Dataset
Using the Telco Customer Churn dataset found on Kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/blastchar/telco-customer-churn/data

Goal: Predict customer churning based on behaviours observed.

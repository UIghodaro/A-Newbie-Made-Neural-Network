# A Newbie Made Neural Network
 A Personal Project created with the aim of properly understanding the workings of NNs in practice, as well as to self-teach the numpy, pandas and basic data analysis techniques.

# Dependencies
Numpy: "pip install numpy"
Pandas: "pip install pandas"
Kagglehub with Pandas adapter: "pip install kagglehub[pandas-datasets]" 

Created using the Telco Customer Churn dataset found on Kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/blastchar/telco-customer-churn/data
This will need to be installed in order to run the program.
